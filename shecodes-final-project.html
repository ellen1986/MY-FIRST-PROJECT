        Study: Piping hot tea, coffee may up esophageal cancer risk

        A recent study has found that the temperature of hot tea is linked with an elevated risk of oesophageal cancer. However,
        previous studies had already established a link between drinking hot tea and oesophageal cancer.
        The study, which appeared in the International Journal of Cancer, has examined this association between hot tea and
        oesophageal cancer by prospectively and objectively measuring tea drinking temperature and following 50,045 individuals
        aged 40 to 75 years for a median of 10 years.
        During follow-up, 317 new cases of oesophageal cancer were identified. Compared with drinking less than 700 ml of tea
        per day at less than 60degC, drinking 700 ml per day or more at a higher temperature (60degC or higher) was associated
        with a 90 percent higher risk of oesophageal cancer.
